# Delphi COVIDcast Open API Data | COVID-19 | Carnegie Mellon University

## Main Description
This resource contains an archived collection of datasets from Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Research Center's COVID-19 Surveillance Streams Data (COVIDcast) - itself an endpoint in Delphi's Epidata open API for Epidemiological Data.

Delphi's COVIDcast datasets are based on a variety of data sources including **a CMU-run Facebook health survey, a Google-run health survey, lab test results provided by Quidel Inc, search data released by Google Health Trends, and outpatient doctor visits provided by a national health system**.
